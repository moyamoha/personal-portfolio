          <p>
            My first ever paid job as a software developer. Eduhouse is a
            e-learning service provider. My role is to contribute in
            further-developing and/or maintaining their platforms and services.
            Eduhouse uses modern stack and new technologies, something that I

          <p>
            At integrify we learned as we developed but most importantly we
            received monitorship from senior developers, so we learned alot from
            our mistakes.

          <p>
            In two and a half year of my academic life, I learned a lot. As
            information tecknology student we learned basics of programming and
            how the computer really works. The most important lesson however was
            how to self-learn. I also liked the math courses except Discrete
            maths. Why do everyone is scared of it? ðŸ˜„

            Ok, it looks short, but for me it was a fruitful spell. How? I got
            to do IT-related work for the first time. I was responsible for a
            variety of things for example installing softwares and basic stuffs

            Here begins the main journey. From installing windows to managing
            windows server 2012, we also learned some basic html and css stuff.
            At the end of it, I knew I definitely wanted higher education in
            some University
